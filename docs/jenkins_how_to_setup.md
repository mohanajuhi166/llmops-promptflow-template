# LLMOps Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Template

## Overview

This template provides a starting point for setting up a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** using **Jenkins** as the platform. Whether you're working on machine learning projects, software development, or any other domain, this template can be customized to fit your specific needs.

## Features

- **Jenkins Integration**: Leverage Jenkins, a powerful automation server, to automate your build, test, and deployment processes.
- **CI/CD Workflow**: Set up a complete CI/CD workflow that includes building, testing, and deploying your applications.
- **Customizable Steps**: Modify the pipeline stages to match your project requirements.
- **Version Control Integration**: Connect your Jenkins pipeline to your version control system (e.g., Git, GitHub, GitLab) for seamless integration.
- **Artifact Management**: Store and manage build artifacts efficiently.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Jenkins installed and configured completely.
   - Set up your version control repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
   - Install any necessary plugins in Jenkins (e.g., Git plugin, Pipeline plugin).

2. **Create a New Jenkins Job**:
   - In Jenkins, create a new job (pipeline) for your project.
   - Configure the job to pull code from your version control repository.

3. **Define Your Pipeline Stages**:
   - Customize the pipeline stages according to your project needs. Common stages include:
     - **Checkout**: Pull the latest code from your repository.
     - **Build**: Compile your code and create build artifacts.
     - **Test**: Run unit tests, integration tests, etc.
     - **Deploy**: Deploy your application to a staging or production environment.
     - **Cleanup**: Clean up temporary files or resources.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Set environment variables within Jenkins for sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials).
   - Use these variables in your pipeline script.

5. **Trigger the Pipeline**:
   - Manually trigger the pipeline or set up webhooks to automatically trigger it on code changes.

6. **Monitor and Improve**:
   - Monitor your pipeline execution and logs.
   - Continuously improve your pipeline by adding error handling, notifications, and additional stages.

## Example Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'make test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'make deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This template provides a foundation for your Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline. Customize it to fit your project requirements, and enjoy automated builds and deployments! ðŸš€
